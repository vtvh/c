`stdlib.h` is a header file in the C programming language that stands for
"standard library." It provides a set of standard functions and macros
that are commonly used in C programs for various purposes, such as memory management, string manipulation, random number generation, and more.


Here are some commonly used functions and macros defined in `stdlib.h`:

- Memory management functions:
  - `malloc()`: Allocates a block of memory.
  - `calloc()`: Allocates and initializes a block of memory.
  - `realloc()`: Changes the size of a previously allocated block of memory.
  - `free()`: Deallocates a block of memory.

- String conversion functions:
  - `atoi()`: Converts a string to an integer.
  - `atof()`: Converts a string to a floating-point number.
  - `itoa()`: Converts an integer to a string.
  - `strtol()`: Converts a string to a long integer.

- Random number generation functions:
  - `rand()`: Generates a pseudo-random integer.
  - `srand()`: Seeds the random number generator.

- Other utility functions:
  - `exit()`: Terminates the program.
  - `system()`: Executes a shell command.
  - `abs()`: Returns the absolute value of an integer.
  - `getenv()`: Retrieves the value of an environment variable.

In addition to these functions, `stdlib.h` also defines various constants and macros, such as `NULL`, `EXIT_SUCCESS`, `EXIT_FAILURE`, and more.

To use the functions and macros defined in `stdlib.h`, you need to include the header file at the beginning of your C program using the `#include` directive:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
```

By including `stdlib.h`, you gain access to the standard library functions and macros, allowing you to perform common tasks in your C programs.
